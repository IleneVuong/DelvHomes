                    <p>After the drastic event of deteriorating ozone, the Machine became installed in all our lives. Public gatherings have long since been abandoned. Reaching an age where people are left with no other choice but to remain underground and indoors. Interacting via technology, living a virtual rather than face-to-face existence in both education and socializing. Delve Homes plans to unite all of these aspects together, providing an affordable and considerable living environment for your best interest.</p>
