                    <h2>What's Included:</h2>
                    <p><strong>24-hour courtesy patrol:</strong> Understanding that crime has no address, courtesy patrols are here to incline the idea of a safe environment. Police departments tend to be understated or overworked, resulting in slower response times to emergency calls. These courtesy patrol drones work efficiently by addressing reports of excessive noise, enforcing facility rules, removing loiterers and trespassers, conduct regular air patrol, monitor package theft, and keep tabs on outsiders that enter the facility. </p>
 
                       <p><strong>High-speed internet access:</strong> Currently, technology is embedded into all our lives, with high speed networks in our homes we can begin to address the digital divide that drives a wedge through our economy and our lives. The belief that every homeowner is entitled to only the best of high speed internet is one DelveHomes certainly follows. The internet allows people to connect, create, and educate themselves in a way that no other resource can. Instead of using money on travel costs to visit a friend or relative, who wouldnâ€™t want to connect within the comfort of their home.</p>

                       <p><strong>Overall Design:</strong> DelveHomes provides a spacious ergonomic design, these two factors sparking an influx of customers. Also providing plenty of storage space and many modern conveniences. DelvesHomes provides updated kitchen spaces and bathrooms every two years, having our customers stay far from repetitive.</p>
